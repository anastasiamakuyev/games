# terminal games 🎮

wasn't too comfortable doing OOP in python. didn't understand threading.  
i understand it now. and do oop in python at work. cool.

simple games — you can run these right in your terminal and play knock-off tetris or snake.  
no fancy graphics. no setup. just run the script and use wasd.

you can also configure the `__init__` in both to customize gameplay.  
make the games faster, slower, harder/easier to win.  
give the snake more food. only give yourself zigzag pieces in tetris. fun.

## 🟩 tetris.py

- made my own shapes (defined by shifts from a center block)  
- uses threading to update the game in the background while you move  
- game board is a 2D array of strings (list of lists)  
- checks collisions manually — no libraries or helpers  
- pieces rotate. lines clear. game ends when new piece can’t fit  
- press `a` to move left, `d` to move right, `s` to go down fast, `w` to rotate  

you can tweak these if you want:

```python
self.box_height = 25
self.box_width = 12
self.win_length = 22
self.current_shape = "I"

## 🐍 snake.py

	-	also terminal-based. also threaded.
	-	uses same 2D grid approach — but with food and a growing snake
	- default start length is 2. game ends on wall collision or self collision
	-	food is random. snake grows when it eats.
	-	you can win if the snake gets long enough

you can change:

```python
self.snake_length = 2        # starting size
self.food_amount = 10        # how much food on the screen
self.win_length = 1000       # what counts as winning

controls are the same:
w = up
a = left
s = down
d = right
(can’t reverse directions. that’s cheating.)
